    There are always 24 hours in a day.

The domain name space contains a tree of domain names

Domain names are read fro left to right and seperated by  "."

A host name with a domain name is known as a FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)

Before the DNS, the Network Information Center (NIC) at Stanford Research Institute (SRI) allocated domain names. 

IANA manages the root zone (.)

The domain name space is a tree; if you control one node, you control all the branches and subtrees.

DNS (Domain Name Server) is a distributed system.

There are 13 root authorities

There are 13 root server addresses

Uses of DNS:
    identifying sources of SPAM
    Detect email spoofing
    HTTP is a request/response protocol.

HTTP is a request/response protocol:
    client sends a request to the server
    server responds

Server status codes:
    1xx– Informational; Request received, continuing process
    2xx– Success; The action was successfully received, understood,and accepted
    3xx– Redirection; Further action must be taken in order to completethe request
    4xx– Client Error; The request contains bad syntax or cannot befulfilled
    5xx– Server Error; The server failed to fulfill an apparently validrequest

HTTP is a Transfer Protocol– serving data, not any specific text format.

HTTP traffic usually is very asymmetric

HTTP 2.0 is out now but we still use HTTP 1.1 as it is currently the dominant one.

Mitigating HTTP overload:
    DNS Round Robin
    Load balancing
    Web cache
    Content Delivery Networks

CDN implications
    CDN sees all trafic
    CDN controls certificate keys

Both HTTP and DNS are trivial to set up but are not trivial to get right.
