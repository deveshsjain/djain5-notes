What happens when we execute a command?
    local host connects to remote host
    sends command
    receives data

Connection to remote host:
    look up host name
    open connection to IP address

Looking up a hostname:
    look up various local files
    open a connection to a DNS server's IP
    ask DNS server to resolve hostname
    get back IP

Working:
    determine which name server to query
    ask who has a route to the nameserver
    open socket to well defined port on remote IP
    send queries
    open socket to requested port on remote IP

tcpdump is a packet analyzer

Application Layer Protocols - SMTP, HTTP
Transport Layer Protocols - TCP, UDP
Network Layer Protocols - IP, ICMP
Physical/ Link Layer Protocols - ARP

ARP: Address Resolution Protocol
ND: Neighbour Discovery

HW1 Comments:
do not specify -i in ssh

use aws ec2 wait

avoid waterfall code

Repeaters- Pretty much obselete

Switches use STP - Spanning Tree Protocol to communicate with all the nodes

Router uses BGP
