Security varies and depends from system to  system.

Risk is the possibility of suffering from harm or loss of data

What is lost if data is compromised:
    access to data
    integrity of data
    availability of services
    reputation
    monetary loss

Determine risk:
    identify assets
    identify threats
    identify vulnerabilities
    Determine likelyhood of damage
    estimate cost of recovery
    estimate cost of defence

Risks are scoped and specific

You can only minimize specific Risks by closing attack vectors

identify:
    what you are protecting
    who you are protecting from
    threats you cannot defend against

Adverseries are human actors with specific goals

You can't protect yourself alone. Lead by example and seek allies

Always consult subject experts from outside your team

Never assume any one protection mechanism is sufficient.
Always assume the other protections you deployed can be circumvented or broken.

Cryptography is not a solution to all the problems
It may provide Security in the areas of:
    Confidentiality
    integrity
    Authenticity

Authentication != Authorization

Two types of Cryptography:
    Public Key - ex. RSA
    Private Key - ex. DES

Never store secrets in code
Always use key management systems

Always hash user passwords, don't encrypt them

Never run services as root, always run a dedicated account.

Always grant access explicitly

There are different classes of vulnerabilities like memory management, race conditions, privilege escalation and confusion

Don't invent your own crypto.

During outsourcing, Always make a conscious decision, never blindly follow the promises without understanding the trade-offs.

Embrace automation

There can always be a human error involved instead of malice

Keep your asset inventory accurate

use multi-factor Authentication

don't MITM your own users
