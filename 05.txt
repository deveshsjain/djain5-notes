7 OSI Layers
    Mnemonic - Past Does Not Tell Someones Present Application

IPv4 is 32 bits
    ex. 11111111 00000000 11110000 00001111

Each IPv4 consists of 4 octets.

IPv4 address are divided into 2 parts by the netmask:
    Network part
    Host part

Hosts on the same domain can talk to each other without a router.

Five classes of IPv4 networks:  Class A,B,C,D,E

First address on the subnet= Network address
Last address on the subnet= Broadcast address

The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) oversees global IP address/AS number allocation,root zone management etc.

Regional Internet Registries (RIR) manage the allocation and registration of Internet number resources within a region of the world.

RIRs assign blocks of IP addresses to the Local Internet Registries(LIR).

LIRs are either ISPs, enterprises using a lot of addresses, or academic institutions.

IPv4 address space depletion is a major worry as more and more devices are added. Since IPv4 is 32 bit, it can only have 2^32 addresses.

IPv6 are 128 bits
i.e. 2^128 addresses
i.e. 6.62 addresses for every atom of the world population combined.

Representation: 8x16 bit fields (words) in case insensitive colon hexadecimal representation.
    ex. 2031:0000:0000:030F:0000:0000:0000:130B

Leading zeros in a field are optional:
i.e. 2031:0:0:30F:0:0:0:130B == 2031:0:0:30F::130B == 2031::30F:0:0:0:130B

0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:00001 == 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 == ::1

You need brackets to distinguish a port from an address:
    IPv4:66.163.162.9:22
    IPv6:[2001:470:1f07:3d1::1]:22

There are 3 kinds of Address scopes:
    Link-Local (example: fe80::e276:63ff:fe72:3900%xennet0)
        Used on a single link
        Packets with link-local source or destination addresses are not forwarded to other links
    
    Unique-Local (fc00::/7)
        Used for private IPv6 networks
        Not globally routable
        Applications similar to RFC 1918
    
    Global (example:2001:470:1f07:3d1::1)
        A globally unique address
        Packets with global addresses can be forwarded to any part of the global network

Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) are assigned by IANA to the RIRs.

One can query databases on the internet about e.g. IP block or ASNinformation via the WHOIS protocol.
    Example: whois www.stevens.edu using www.domaintools.com returns the following result:
        Domain Name: STEVENS.EDU
